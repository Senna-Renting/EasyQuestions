# EasyQuestions

Every once and a while I will post a new interesting question for myself to answer, which I will then spend time on answering during the week.
The structure of each notebook will be as follows:

1. Question to find an answer for
2. What relevant open source datasets exist?
3. What algorithm or method do I use to find results in the data, and why do I use it?
4. Code that gives results
5. Results
